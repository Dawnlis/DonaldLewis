		<div id="info">I grew up in Youngstown, Ohio. In my childhood I loved to play any computer
		games I could get my hands on. Mario Kart, Sims 2, Tetris. I also spent way too much time
		watching cartoons! Fairly Odd Parents, Jimmy Neutron, Spongebob, Danny Phantom, Dragonball Z. 
		I was obsessed with the creation of these things. How could someone draw on paper and create moving 
		lovable characters that really felt alive?</div>
		<div id="info">This hybrid experience of video games and cartoons is what I think gave me my passion for computers and
		animation. Animators now use computers more than ever to bring their creations to life so they can
		be experienced and loved by people across the planet. I think this relationship between computers and art
		is incredibly interesting and is what I strive to excel at in my career. Not just animation, but designing
		websites and how people interact with them. </div>
