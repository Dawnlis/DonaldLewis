		<div class="info">	I grew up in Youngstown, Ohio. In my childhood I loved to play any computer
		games I could get my hands on. Mario Kart, Sims 2, Tetris. I also spent way too much time
		watching cartoons! I was obsessed with the creation of these things. How could someone draw on paper or type 
		some code and create games and characters that really felt alive? Innovative websites that have been around since
		the early 2000s, Youtube, social media sites, E-Commerce sites, all of these things improve peoples lives and connect
		them around the world. Computers and technology is a fascinating industry that I want to be a part of.
		</div>
		
		<div class="info">This hybrid experience of video games, cartoons, and other online experiences is what I think gave me my passion 
		for computers and computer design. Supporting users and colleagues with system configuration, networking, hardware, etc. is how
		I want to be a part of this process. Communication is very important to me and it is something I always
		strive to be proficient at in every capacity of my life. Growing up I had a wonderful experience with technology and now
		as an adult I want to be a part of that process. I want to provide a positive user experience for everyone involved.
