		<div class="info">I grew up in Youngstown, Ohio. In my childhood I loved to play any computer
		games I could get my hands on. Mario Kart, Sims 2, Tetris. I also spent way too much time
		watching cartoons! I was obsessed with the creation of these things. How could someone draw on paper or type 
		some code and create games and characters that really felt alive?</div>
		<div class="info">This hybrid experience of video games and cartoons is what I think gave me my passion for computers and
		graphic design. Supporting users and colleagues with system configuration, networking, hardware, etc. is how
		I want to be a part of this process. Communication is very important to me and it is something I always
		strive to be proficient at in every capacity of my life. Growing up I had a wonderful experience with technology and now
		as an adult I want to be a part of that process. I want to provide a positive user experience for everyone involved.</div>
